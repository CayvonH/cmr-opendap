;;; We're going to codify parameters with records to keep things well
;;; documented. Additionally, this will make converting between parameter
;;; schemes an explicit operation on explicit data.

;; Notes on representing spatial extents.
;;
;; EDSC uses URL-encoded long/lat numbers representing a bounding box
;; Note that the ordering is the same as that used by CMR (see below).
;;  `-9.984375%2C56.109375%2C19.828125%2C67.640625`
;; which URL-decodes to:
;;  `-9.984375,56.109375,19.828125,67.640625`
;;
;; OPeNDAP download URLs have something I haven't figured out yet; given that
;; one of the numbers if over 180, it can't be degrees ... it might be what
;; WCS uses for `x` and `y`?
;;  `Latitude[22:34],Longitude[169:200]`
;;
;; The OUS Prototype uses the WCS standard for lat/long:
;;  `SUBSET=axis[,crs](low,high)`
;; For lat/long this takes the following form:
;;  `subset=lat(56.109375,67.640625)&subset=lon(-9.984375,19.828125)`
;;
;; CMR supports bounding spatial extents by describing a rectangle using four
;; comma-separated values:
;;  1. lower left longitude
;;  2. lower left latitude
;;  3. upper right longitude
;;  4. upper right latitude
;; For example:
;;  `bounding_box==-9.984375,56.109375,19.828125,67.640625`
;;
;; Google's APIs use lower left, upper right, but the specify lat first, then
;; long:
;;  `southWest = LatLng(56.109375,-9.984375);`
;;  `northEast = LatLng(67.640625,19.828125);`
